# Upload Assistant (CvT Edition)

I have no clue what I'm doing so thought I'd fork it, bork it and, duct tape it back together to get people to sing my praises. Hopefully it works and makes your life simplier.

## What It Can Do:
  - Generates and Parses MediaInfo/BDInfo.
  - Generates and Uploads screenshots.
  - Uses srrdb to fix scene filenames
  - Can grab descriptions from PTP (automatically on filename match or arg) / BLU (arg)
  - Obtains TMDb/IMDb/MAL identifiers.
  - Converts absolute to season episode numbering for Anime
  - Generates custom .torrents without useless top level folders/nfos.
  - Can re-use existing torrents instead of hashing new
  - Generates proper name for your upload using Mediainfo/BDInfo and TMDb/IMDb conforming to site rules
  - Checks for existing releases already on site
  - Adds to your client with fast resume, seeding instantly (rtorrent/qbittorrent/deluge/watch folder)
  - ALL WITH MINIMAL INPUT!
  - Currently works with .mkv/.mp4/Blu-ray/DVD/HD-DVDs

## Coming Soon:
  - Auto-Mode (This will require an overhaul of code so once this goes through it wont be compatible with L4G's UA)


  

## **Setup:**
   - **REQUIRES AT LEAST PYTHON 3.7 AND PIP3**
   - Needs [mono](https://www.mono-project.com/) on linux systems for BDInfo
   - Also needs MediaInfo and ffmpeg installed on your system
      - On Windows systems, ffmpeg must be added to PATH I recomend using https://scoop.sh/ , alternatively follow this guide for manual installation (https://windowsloop.com/install-ffmpeg-windows-10/) 
      - On linux systems, get it from your favorite package manager
      - On Mac OS either install in brew, or get static builds and place in `/usr/bin` or (better practice) create your own bin ex:`$HOME/.local/bin` then edit `$HOME/.zshrc` by adding export `PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin"`
   - Clone the repo to your system `git clone https://github.com/z-ink/Upload-Assistant.git`
   - Copy and Rename `data/example-config.py` to `data/config.py`
   - Edit `config.py` to use your information (more detailed information in the [wiki](https://github.com/L4GSP1KE/Upload-Assistant/wiki))
      - tmdb_api (v3) key can be obtained from https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction
      - image host api keys can be obtained from their respective sites
   - Install necessary python modules `pip3 install --user -U -r requirements.txt`
